# Artificial-Intelligence-Projects
# Description :
I am creating this repository for Artificial Intelligence Projects ,that I have done during my AI internship at  **pantecsolution** . I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve, simplify, or make the code more efficient. If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me: vdatir218@gmail.com 

# Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) . If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
   
```javascript
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
