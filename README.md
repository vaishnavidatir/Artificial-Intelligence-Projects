# Artificial-Intelligence-Projects
# Description :
I am creating this repository for Artificial Intelligence Projects ,that I have done during my AI internship at  **pantecsolution** . I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve, simplify, or make the code more efficient. If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me: vdatir218@gmail.com 

# Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) . If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
   
```javascript
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Run


**For Window OS**


for setting Environment Variables in Windows Os refer this following Tutorial

https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/121855-edit-user-system-environment-variables-windows.html


https://www.onmsft.com/how-to/how-to-set-an-environment-variable-in-windows-10

**Attention:** Please perform the steps given in these tutorials at your own risk. Please don't mess up with the System Variables. It can potentially damage your PC. You should know what you're doing.

# Prerequisite:
 After setting Environmental Variable ,we need to install some Libraries that needed for our projects,to install libraries follow following steps:
 > Run command prompt as Administrator and install each library using following commands:
 * **Matplotlib** : Matplotlib is one of the most popular Python packages used for data visualization. It is a cross-platform library for making 2D plots from data in arrays. It        provides an object-oriented API that helps in embedding plots in applications using Python GUI toolkits such as PyQt, WxPythonotTkinter. For showing multiple images in one      window ,we are insatlling this library here.


  ```javascript
  pip install matplotlib
  ```
 
 * **Imutils** : A series of convenience functions to make basic image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, displaying Matplotlib images,      sorting contours, detecting edges, and much more easier with OpenCV  .


  ```javascript
  pip install imutils
  ```

* **Wheel** : Wheels are a component of the Python ecosystem that helps to make package installs just work. They allow for faster installations and more stability in the package       distribution process.

 
   ```javascript
   pip install wheel
   ```

* **PIL(Python Imaging Library)** : It adds support for opening,manipulating, and saving many different image formats.
   ```javascript
   pip install Pillow
   ```

* **Opencv** : OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision,with installation of opencv library Numerical Python library too get install so   no need to install numpy again . NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large     collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
   ```javascript
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

* **Scientific Python(SciPy)** : SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing.
   ```javascript
   pip install scipy
   ```
* **Opencv-Contrib** : Consist of Additional  Contribution Packages of Opencv.
   ```javascript
   pip install opencv-contrib-python
   ```

# Files
 > Download haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file from [here](https://osdn.net/projects/sfnet_magicvisionport/downloads/mvp/cascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml/) .



 > For capturing images from your smartphone download **IP WEBCAM** app from **Playstore** to your smartphone ,and connect your laptop with same network on which smartphone        connected and then run start server option from app,the camera will be open with that ,you will get server address use that in program as your url, and simultaneously run the     program ,you will get result.
